# What are the pros and cons of TDD?
A benefit of TDD is modular code. Since a unit test is written first, the code that follows will be modular because one test is being satisfied at a time. Modular code is easy to document and is important for the code to be maintainable. The resulting code is very robust because of the frequency of testing. All functionalities are automatically covered by tests during TDD. Any regressions from adding a new feature is caught early by the existing unit tests. This also means that less debugging is needed. Refactoring code becomes easier because the tests will catch errors caused by refactoring.

A drawback of using TDD is slow development time. A project will take longer to get started because tests and code are being written at the same time. In the long term, if there is a change in requirements, the tests have to change before the code is edited. Another disadvantage of TDD is that developers may become overconfident when all the units tests are passing. The tests may not cover all the corner cases and the code can fail integration testing.
